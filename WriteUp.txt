SS1- This is using solely elevation for biome determinations, I just thought it was cool how it reached across the screen.
We could replicate something like this by having directions weighted and guiding it in a certain direction rather than allowing it free roaming.

SS2- This is using solely North/South of the equator for biome determinations. I thought it looked like Africa if it was flooded in the south. The desert even
lined up with roughly the Sahara desert. This could be replicated via learning algorithms examining real world maps and adding twists or melting the north pole.

SS3- This is using both elevation and an equator to determine biomes. I liked this one reaching down as well, but liked mostly how it favored the South and made the
equator off center. This can be replicated using the same logic as with screen shot 1, but then setting the equator to be off center to begin with.

I wasn't terribly pleased with my height randomization, I think that a few extra passes could smooth it out but would result in alot more time spent on a loading screen.
I managed to get a temperature score, which is what I use in determining biomes. It is partially randomized, which is why some super south locations can still be a forest
or some other biome amidst the snow.

I'm looking forward to learning more about PCG, despite my project having some short comings, it was fun to work on.
